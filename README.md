# Use Case
Over the past few years, HowWeRoll Rentals, the world’s largest recreational vehicle (RV) rental company, has dominated the RV rental marketplace. Its tagline is “We have great service because that’s How We Roll!” Its rental fleet includes every style of camper vehicle, from palatial mobile homes to old-school, chrome Airstream campers. If you’re plagued with wanderlust, HowWeRoll has the cure!

As the lead Salesforce developer for HowWeRoll, you’ve been instrumental in making the company a huge success. In order to continue revenue growth, the company’s leadership has decided to expand beyond its core RV market and enter the recreational boating industry, as surveys have shown that a large share of RV travelers are also boat owners. Instead of investing in boats of its own, HowWeRoll plans to start a boat-sharing program where the company acts as a leasing agent for its customers’ boats. HowWeRoll is calling this new service Friend Ships.

Tatiana Loyal is the stellar Salesforce developer at HowWeRoll. She’s started an implementation of a custom Lightning interface, surfaced in Lightning Experience, but she’s now out on maternity leave. You’ve been asked to continue her work developing a Lightning application that enables sales associates to enter information about their customers’ boats, including boat’s locations. You’ve also been asked to enable your team members to post comments and ratings about their experiences when they inspect each boat.

Rather than start over, you begin with some code written by Tatiana. As you know—good programmers write good code; great programmers reuse good code.

First you develop a custom search engine so HowWeRoll’s sales associates can dynamically filter the boats based on boat type (such as a fishing boat, pleasure boat, party boat) in order to match customer requests with the boating inventory.

Then you create a map that displays up to 10 boats based on the current user’s location.

Finally, you convert an existing, outdated Visualforce page that shows boats similar to the search query into a reusable solution with Lightning Web Components.
